This project is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built in Java.i learned the knowlege based on the Course 
ðŸš©NOTICE:the code is like what the Educator taught.

ðŸŽˆThey choose the row and column from Number 0 to 2!!!!
ðŸŽˆThe game checks if someone has won (row, column, or diagonal) or if the game ends in a tie.
